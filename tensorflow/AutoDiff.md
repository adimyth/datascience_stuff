## Dual Numbers
Dual number of a real number $a$ is of the form $a+b*\epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is a very small number such that $\epsilon^2=0$, meaning that it is a very small number & $b$ is usually 1.


While performing any binary operation between a real number and a dual number, we convert real number to it's dual form using 0 for the dual component. For example; calculating $3*x at x=4+1*\epsilon$
```bash
Convert $3$ to it's dual form: $3+0*\epsilon$.

$(3+0*\epsilon)*(4+1*\epsiolon)$
$12+0*\epsilon+3*\epsilon+0*\epsilon^2$
$12+3*\epsilon$
```
