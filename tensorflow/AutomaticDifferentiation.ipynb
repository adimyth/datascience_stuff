    "# Dual Numbers\n",
    "Dual number of a real number $a$ is of the form $a+b\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is a very small number such that $\\epsilon^2=0$, meaning that it is a very small number & $b$ is usually 1.\n",

    "## Basic Arithmetic\n",
    "### Addition / Subtraction\n",
    "Adding & subtracting two dual numbers is similar to adding or subtracting two complex numbers, we deal with real and dual numbers seperately.\n",
    "$$(3 + 4\\epsilon) + (1 + 2\\epsilon) = 4 + 6\\epsilon$$\n",
    "$$(3 + 4\\epsilon) - (1 + 2\\epsilon) = 2 + 2\\epsilon$$\n",

    "### Multiplication\n",

    "\n",
    "While performing any binary operation between a real number and a dual number, we convert real number to it's dual form using 0 for the dual component. For example; calculating $3x$ at $x=4+1\\epsilon$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of calculating $f(a)$ if we calculate the function's value for it's dual number i.e. $f(a+b\\epsilon)$, we end up getting $f(a)$ and $f'(a)$ both. For example, we will start with $f(x)=3x+2$ and calculate $f(4)$ and $f'(4)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step1** - We convert our $4$ into a dual number, using $1$ for the dual component. It gives us $4+1\\epsilon$\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have a completely mechanical way to evaluate derivatives at a point. **This mechanism works for any function that can be composed out of the primitive operations that we have extended to dual numbers.** \n",
    "2. It turns every arithmetic operation into a fixed number of new arithmetic operations, so the **arithmetic cost goes up by a small constant factor.** For example, addition requires 2 extra steps. Similarily, multiplication requires 3 additional steps and so on. \n",
    "3. We also do not introduce any gross numerical sins, so we can reasonably expect the accuracy of the derivative to be no worse than that of the primal computation.3"
